  abstract      = {Abstract Selection of aptamers from oligonucleotide libraries currently requires multiple rounds of alternating steps of partitioning of binders from nonbinders and enzymatic amplification of all collected oligonucleotides. Herein, we report a highly practical solution for reliable one-step selection of aptamers. We introduce partitioning by ideal-filter capillary electrophoresis (IFCE) in which binders and nonbinders move in the opposite directions. The efficiency of IFCE-based partitioning reaches 109, which is ten million times higher than that of typical solid-phase partitioning methods. One step of IFCE-based partitioning is sufficient for the selection of a high-affinity aptamer pool for a protein target. Partitioning by IFCE promises to become an indispensable tool for fast and robust selection of binders from different types of oligonucleotide libraries.},

  abstract = {Capillary electrophoresis (CE) played an important role in developments in the life sciences. The technique is nowadays used for the analysis of both large and small molecules in applications where it performs better than or is complementary to liquid chromatographic techniques. In this review, principles of different electromigration techniques, especially capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF), capillary gel (CGE) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), are described and recent developments in instrumentation, with an emphasis on mass spectrometry (MS) coupling and microchip CE, are discussed. The role of CE in the life sciences is shown with applications in which it had a high impact over the past few decades. In this context, current practice for the characterization of biopharmaceuticals (therapeutic proteins) is shown with CIEF, CGE and CZE using different detection techniques, including MS. Subsequently, the application of CGE and CZE, in combination with laser induced fluorescence detection and CZE-MS are demonstrated for the analysis of protein-released glycans in the characterization of biopharmaceuticals and glycan biomarker discovery in biological samples. Special attention is paid to developments in capillary coatings and derivatization strategies for glycans. Finally, routine CE analysis in clinical chemistry and latest developments in metabolomics approaches for the profiling of small molecules in biological samples are discussed. The large number of CE applications published for these topics in recent years clearly demonstrates the established role of CE in life sciences.},

  abstract = {We present an experimental approach to conducting fast capillary electrophoresis--mass spectrometry (CE-MS) measurements of very small samples in the nanoliter range. This is achieved by injecting sample very efficiently into a CE-MS system. Injection efficiency represents the ratio of injected sample to the amount of sample needed for carrying out the injection process (v/v). In order to increase this injection efficiency from typical values of 10--3 to 10−7, the concept of capillary batch injection is used to build an automated, small-footprint injection device for CE-MS. This device is capable of running true multi-sample measurement series, using minimal sample volumes and delivering an injection efficiency of up to 100 {\%}. It is compatible with both aqueous and non-aqueous background electrolytes. As an additional benefit, CE-MS separations of a catecholamine model system in capillaries of 15 cm length under conditions of high electric field strength could be accomplished in 20 s with high separation efficiency. This report details design and specifications of the injection device and shows optimal parameter choices for injections with both high injection efficiency and high separation efficiency. Furthermore, a procedure is presented to coat the tip of a fused silica capillary with a silicone elastomer which acts as a seal between two capillaries.},

  abstract = {The main aim of this study was to apply capillary electrophoresis (CE) to the discrimination of red lipsticks – the first step towards developing the methodology for forensic purposes. The separation method was optimized using a mixture of eight dyes and micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC). The influence of the buffer pH and the concentration of SDS on the separation of dye mixtures was investigated. The best separation (highly efficient with the large resolution capacity in relatively short time) was accomplished using a buffer at pH 9 enriched with 80 mM SDS. The developed separation method was evaluated, determining the stability of sample (5 h) and buffer (10 h), the limit of detection of dyes (LOD < 1 μg·mL−1), the repeatability of migration times in one day (RSD < 1.2%), and over three days (RSD < 2.4%), as well as the reproducibility using different capillaries and CE instruments. In order to develop a versatile extraction method for compounds from red lipsticks, various types of solvents, temperatures and durations of ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) were tested. The use of a specially designed and constructed device for repetitive sampling without contamination was suggested. The extraction method was characterized in terms of precision, obtaining very good results for the qualitative (RSD of migration time < 2.0%) and quantitative (RSD of peak height < 10.0%) methods. The proposed UAE/MEKC-DAD method was successfully applied to distinguish red lipstick samples with a very similar hue, achieving a high value of discrimination power (DP = 0.998). It was found that it has great potential in forensic investigations.},

  abstract = {Determination of the oligosaccharide composition in different wort samples is important to monitor their change during the brewing process with different yeast types. In our work, the concentration of fermentable and non-fermentable sugars were monitored by capillary electrophoresis to observe the effect of two different types of yeasts, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomycodes ludwigii. The former first ferments the monosaccharides, then the higher sugar oligomers, such as maltose and maltotriose, to ethanol, while the latter fully ferments the monosaccharides, but ferments only very low percentages of the oligosaccharides. Therefore, breweries use Saccharomycodes ludwigii to produce beers with low alcohol content. The CE-LIF traces of the wort samples represented unique oligosaccharide signatures.},

  abstract  = {Background Tobacco smoking by pregnant women has a negative effect on fetal development and increases pregnancy risk by changing the oxidative balance and microelements level. Smoking affects the concentration, structure and function of proteins, potentially leading to various negative effects on pregnancy outcomes.   Methodology/Principal Findings The influence of tobacco smoke on key protein fractions in smoking and non-smoking healthy pregnant women was determined by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Concentrations of the proteins α1-antitrypsin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α2-macroglobulin and transferrin were determined by ELISA tests. Total protein concentration was measured by the Biuret method. Smoking status was established by cotinine levels. Cadmium (Cd) and Zinc (Zn) concentrations were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and the Zn/Cd ratio was calculated based on these numbers. Smoking women had a 3.7 times higher level of Cd than non-smoking women. Zn levels decreased during pregnancy for all women. The Zn/Cd ratio was three times lower in smoking women. The differences between the changes in the protein profile for smoking and non-smoking women were noted. Regarding proteins, α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin levels were lower in the non-smoking group than in the smoking group and correlated with Cd levels (r = -0.968, p = 0.032 for non-smokers; r = −0.835, p = 0.019 for smokers). Zn/Cd ratios correlated negatively with α1-, α2- and β-globulins.   Conclusions/Significance Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the concentration of Cd in the blood of pregnant women and may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy disorders. During pregnancy alter concentrations of some proteins. The correlation of Cd with proteins suggests that it is one of the causes of protein aberrations.},
